Reflection Workshop 2

After finish this workshop, I have learned about how to declare and allocate many dynamic memory.
And how to deallocation to the pointer is not leak memory... I have more practice about references parameter.
I also practice more input and output in C++...Everything is interesting for me.
They are very helpful for me.
