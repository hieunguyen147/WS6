Reflection Workshop 1

After finish this workshop, I have learned about how to declare and define a namespace.
I have more practice and validating the number input form the user through functions.
I also practice input and output in C++, dynamic memory... Moreover, I also reviewed 
the way to sort an array before display the value. Everything is interesting for me.
Thank to the workshop, and there are still many things new with me, so I hope I can try 
hard to adapt all of them. They are very helpful for my opportunity to find a great job.
